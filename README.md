# Source code for study on the association of microbiome and obeisty in Children of 1997 birth cohort.
The data that used in this code to generate findings of the case-control study are available from the “Children of 1997” birth cohort, but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Data are however available upon reasonable request and with permission of the “Children of 1997” data access committee: aprmay97@hku.hk. 

The genetic data for the Mendelian randomization study were downloaded from the links listed below:
Summary data for the genetic associations with microbiome species from the 4D-SZ GWAS was downloaded from https://ftp.cngb.org/pub/CNSA/data2/CNP0000794/.
Summary data for the genetic associations with type 2 diabetes from the AGEN consortium was downloaded from https://blog.nus.edu.sg/agen/summary-statistics/t2d-2020/. 
Summary data for the genetic associations with coronary artery disease from Biobank Japan was downloaded from http://jenger.riken.jp/en/result.
